# WebXR Squat
### Let's do squats together!

<br>

This application calculates whether you are squatting based on the current height of your HMD.<br>
Press the trigger on the right controller to reset the neutral position.

<br>

> **Note:** This experience includes background music. Please enjoy the music I created.

2. Add rigging, animations, and export the model using [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) (Air Squat Bent Arms, Yelling, Waving).
3. Use [Blender](https://www.blender.jp/)'s NLA editor to apply multiple animations to the model.

4. Compress the model and export it as a GLB file, then place it under `public/models` (the code references it as `hmdMan.glb`).
5. Run the following command.

```

```

6.  Open the following link in a browser that supports WebXR on an HMD.(Replace "?" with the IP address)
